# Travelling Salesmen Problem

This is an assignment done in the course - "Artificial Intelligence Search Methods For Problem Solving" taught by Prof. Deepak Khemani, in the 2021 Fall Semester.

This assignment is about solving the optimal tour need to be performed by the travelling salesmen, given the cities in the form of co-ordinates.
The instructions and rules about the assignment and the input methods are mentioned in the pdf - "[CS6380 Assignment 1.pdf](https://github.com/nithin-uppalapati/travelling_salesmen_problem/blob/main/CS6380%20Assignment%201.pdf)".

I have explored and implemented the following Algorithms:

1. Simulated Annealing (SA)
2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
3. List Based Simulated Annealing (LBSA)

The methopdologies and my observations are mentioned in detail, in the [report](https://github.com/nithin-uppalapati/travelling_salesmen_problem/blob/main/35_Report.pdf)
